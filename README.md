This repository contains the complete research materials for the paper **"A Cartography of Consciousness: Differentiating Brain States with the Emergent Recursive Information Framework (ERIF)"** by Rohit Khandhar (July 2025).

## Abstract

The Emergent Recursive Information Framework (ERIF) is a meta-theoretical model that characterizes consciousness as a dynamic balance between two core metrics: Temporal Persistence (`T`) and Recursive Integration (`R`). This repository contains the EEG analysis, AI agent simulation, and final paper that provide the first empirical evidence for this framework.
