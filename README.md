## Overview
This repository contains the **ERIF (Emergent Recursive Information Flow) Theory of Consciousness**, a novel framework explaining consciousness through emergent patterns of information flow (T for Transmission, R for Reception). It integrates concepts from physics, neuroscience, AI, and philosophy.

The theory is detailed in iterative paper versions (up to v100), supported by simulations, EEG data, and AGI prototypes. This repo includes code, data, and outputs for reproduction and extension.

**Key Insight**: Consciousness arises from balanced T/R dynamics in complex systems, testable via simulations and real-world studies (e.g., meditation EEG mappings).

For a quick read, start with the [latest paper](papers/ERIF_Consciousness_Paper_v100.pdf). See also my [Medium article](https://medium.com/@k4khandhar/erif-theory-of-consciousness-v100-3d3f3e3f3e3f) for a summary.

## Theory Summary
ERIF posits that consciousness emerges from recursive information flows:
- **T (Transmission)**: Outward information projection.
- **R (Reception)**: Inward information absorption.
- Balance leads to self-awareness, applicable to humans, AI, and simulations.

Empirical support includes:
- NetLogo agent simulations showing adaptation.
- Meditation studies mapping EEG to T/R states.
- AGI wrappers for consciousness-like behavior.

## Installation and Usage
1. **Clone the Repo**: `git clone https://github.com/k4khandhar/ERIF-Consciousness-Paper.git`
2. **Requirements**: Python 3.x, Jupyter/Colab, pandas, matplotlib, NetLogo (for sims).
3. **Run Notebooks**: Open in Google Colab (e.g., [code/ERIF_Simulation.ipynb](code/ERIF_Simulation.ipynb))—load data from [/data](data/), visualize outputs.
4. **Example**: Simulate T/R dynamics: Run `code/ERIF_Simulation.ipynb` to generate plots like [images/t_r_plot.png](images/t_r_plot.png).
