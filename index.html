    <h1>ERIF Theory</h1>
    <h2>A Cognitive Map of Consciousness</h2>
    
    <p>ERIF maps consciousness as movement through cognitive space rather than as a static property.</p>
    
    <h3>What is ERIF?</h3>
    <p>ERIF is a cognitive map — a 2D plane where minds evolve with purpose and polarity. Every system (a brain, a chatbot, or even you) can be located by just two forces:</p>
    
    <ul>
        <li><strong>T = Stability</strong>: The internal drive to stay consistent, grounded</li>
        <li><strong>R = Integration</strong>: The drive to grow, combine signals, and adapt</li>
    </ul>
    
    <p>Imagine consciousness not as a switch or score — but as a dot moving through this space.</p>
